Forest Fire Machine Learning Model
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting forest fires using Ridge Linear Regression.
The model has been chosen for its accuracy in predicting forest fire occurrences based on historical data.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the model consists of various features related to weather conditions,
vegetation, and other factors that influence forest fire occurrences.
The dataset includes both input features and the corresponding target variable, which indicates whether a forest fire occurred (1) or not (0) in a given area.

Model
The model implemented in this repository is based on Ridge Linear Regression.
Ridge regression is a regularized version of linear regression that helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.
This penalty term controls the complexity of the model and reduces the impact of high-variance features.

The Ridge Linear Regression model has been chosen for its ability to handle multicollinearity among the input features and provide accurate predictions.
The regularization parameter has been tuned to optimize the trade-off between bias and variance.
